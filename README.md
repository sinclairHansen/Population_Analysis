# Population_Analysis


This is my first data visualization project and it looks at a large world population dataset. 

Language: Python

Libraries: matplotlib, numpy, pandas, seaborn, and folium.

I learned a lot about dissecting a large dataset and efficiently displaying it in multiple styles of graphs. I also haven't used python in a while, so this project reinforced a lot of tools.

The Folium graphs may not be visible in the .ipynb file so they are also attached in two seperate .png files

Enjoy!
